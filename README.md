# Delivery Website - Git Course Project
This project is part of the Git course and consists of a delivery website. The website allows users to browse through a list of dishes and add the desired items to their shopping cart. The cart displays the total price of the items selected. Additionally, the website includes a secure payment processing option for users to complete their orders.

This project was developed using Git version control system, and it was a great opportunity to learn and practice Git concepts such as branching, merging, and collaborating with other team members on the same project.
